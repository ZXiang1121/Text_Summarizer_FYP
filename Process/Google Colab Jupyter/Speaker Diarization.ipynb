movie for kids\n","speaker 2: yes it\n","speaker 1: is we aren't interested in movies for kids we want to watch something more mature what about a horror movie maybe what is the horror movie about it's about zombies is there a lot of action yes it's a very exciting and thrilling film there's a lot of action but I should warn you there is also a little bit of romance in the movie really romance and a zombie movie yes in fact the romance is between a man and a zombie that sounds hilarious will take two tickets please now you were going to listen to a conversation between two friends Christine and Ryan they're talking about their daily routine activities after the conversation I will also ask some questions about it try to answer the questions out loud so you will improve your English speaking skills okay are you ready let's get started hey Ryan over here oh there you are Christine sorry I'm late that's no problem what held you up I've just had a busy morning oh really yeah lately my mornings have been packed full of things to do I'm feeling overwhelmed I'm sorry to hear that what all do you have to do every morning well usually I sleep in past my alarm because I'm too tired to get up so my alarm goes off at 6 but I usually hit the snooze for at least an hour I normally get out of bed after 7 why are you so tired in the morning hello are you enjoying the story please give us a like thank you it's my fault I usually go out with my friends for a drink at about 10 at night and so I get back home after midnight then I usually play video games or look at social media until I finally go to bed at 2 oh that's not good you should go to bed sooner I know I think I'm addicted to my phone okay so how else is your morning so busy well as I said I usually wake up too late what else as soon as I get up I have to take my dog outside to go potty then I usually threw the ball for him so he can exercise by then it is already 7:30 and I still haven't eaten breakfast brush my teeth or gotten dressed and my boss leaves for work at 7:45 that seems a little tight how far is the bus stop from your home it's a five-minute walk if I walk fast which I always do I quickly get dressed and brush my teeth and I usually skip breakfast then I run out the door and rush to the bus stop if all goes well I arrive at work by 8:45 then I usually grab a candy bar or a soda before starting work then I work until lunch when I usually go and get some fast food with some friends at the end of the work day I rush home to play computer games for a few hours before I order pizza or fast\n","speaker 2: food for dinner\n","speaker 1: after dinner I watch TV until around 10 then it's time to hit the bar and hang out with my friends it sounds like you could change your schedule around that would help you be healthier and have more energy oh really what can I change if you like this video and want to see more videos like it be sure to subscribe to our Channel thanks for watching oh really what can I change well you could go to bed earlier after dinner consider watching some TV before going to bed before midnight then you'll get at least two more hours of sleep I see but then when would I see my friends yes you would miss out on seeing your friends at the bar every night you could consider asking them to meet you after work before you eat dinner or perhaps you can only see your friends on the weekend but when you go to bed earlier at night you will wake up in the morning feeling refreshed then you'll have enough time to eat a healthy breakfast before you head out to the bus stop that's a good idea I get very tired in the mid-morning it may be because of the candy and soda I eat when I get to work yes skip the candy and soda and also consider using your free time in the morning to pack a healthy lunch eating fast food everyday isn't just unhealthy it's also expensive wow I can't wait to make these changes in my daily routine I feel better already I'm happy to help Ryan tell me Christine what does your daily routine look like I'm so glad you asked I usually wake up at about 6 in the morning the first thing I do is drink a big glass of water so I start the day off feeling hydrated after that I do some sort of exercise for about 30 minutes I will either run to yoga or lift weights following that I take a shower get dressed and put on my makeup I don't usually eat a light breakfast of oatmeal or eggs by that time it is usually about 8 I quickly pack a salad or sandwich for my lunch and then I ride my bike to work which takes about 20 minutes when I get to work I like the first catch up on emails then I check my calendar to see what meetings I have I work through the morning and then I sit outside and eat the salad or sandwich I packed for lunch then I returned to work for the afternoon since I usually arrive early I also leave a little bit early which helps me to beat the traffic on the way home I often stop by the store to pick up fresh food for dinner in the evening I sometimes hang out with friends or I will watch TV or read I cooked dinner and eat at about 7 and then I wind down before going to bed at 10 wow that sounds like a very good day are you able to fall asleep so early oh yes because I exercise every morning and ride my bicycle to and from work I'm plenty tired by 10 at night you know this was really helpful Christine I think I may even buy a bicycle and ride to work a few days per week great idea Ryan just don't overdo it consider changing your schedule one step at a time so that you don't get burnt out I will do that say it's been really nice chatting with you Christine I think I will run to the store and pick up some healthy food for dinner\n","speaker 2: thank you for meeting\n","speaker 1: with me anytime Ryan take care bye\n","speaker 2: bye\n","speaker 1: okay back to the beginning with questions you must answer every question is your pause button and answer the question then play again you can answer with just one word or two words it's okay short answers are okay always answer the questions with a strong voice this is so important when you do this you teach your mind you teach your brain to be confident when you speak English your English will improve much much faster why does Ryan usually sleep in past his arm because he is too tired to get up he sleeps in past his alarm because he is too tired\n","speaker 2: to get up\n","speaker 1: does Ryan sleep in past his alarm because he can hear it no he doesn't he doesn't sleep in past his alarm because he can't hear it he sleeps in past his alarm because he is too tired to get up what time does Ryan's alarm go off at 6 his alarm goes off at 6 what time does Ryan normally get out\n","speaker 2: of bed\n","speaker 1: after 7 he normally gets out of bed after 7 does Ryan normally go to bed at 10 every night no he doesn't do usually goes out with his friends for a drink at about 10 at\n","speaker 2: night\n","speaker 1: what time does Ryan get back home after midnight he gets back home after midnight listen to the lessons repeatedly to think in English and automatic speaking repetition is very very important to become fluid you need to speak English fluently and without translating in your head the word should come out of your mouth automatically so this is where the repetition comes in if you repeat the same vocabulary and sentence has many times you will become a master of this vocabulary and grammar so you will be able to use that words automatically without thinking about grammar rules and without translating vocabulary in\n","speaker 2: your head\n","speaker 1: in order to think in English you must repeat vocabulary and sentence has as much as you can after lots of repetition eventually you will start to think English in your head and improve your speaking skills as I mentioned before we use the question-and-answer method repeatedly in our short story lessons so you will listen to the vocabulary and sentences many times in the same lesson if you want to complete your practice of the story you can go to English easy practice.com and download the audio lessons of the
